Hey, y'all!

These aren't really rules, but just general guidelines so that everybody can feel included, and we can avoid misunderstandings.

We welcome anyone who considers themselves to be queer or part of the LGBTQ+ community, including people who are questioning, allies, intersectional feminists, and the like.

As in any queer community, lesbo/homo/bi/trans/queer+ phobia, sexism, bigotry, etc., is not tolerated.

We're here to enjoy each other's company & play a block game together - respect people's boundaries & make sure everyone has fun!

Pro tip: if you're questioning whether something is allowed, ask yourself (or others) if there is a chance you might hurt someone in doing so.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
